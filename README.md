# Project SHAdow

****Logo Soon****

****The goal:****

  The goal of Project SHAdow is to help beginners like myself gain experience with jailbreaking and the exploitation of vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking can be frustrating to start, but I hope to mirror an actual, maintainable jailbreak that you can dive into, poke around, and give you a feel for this stuff.

****The exploit:****

  Based on SHAtter exploit (segment overflow) by posixninja and pod2g
  A very good presentation for understanding the underlying bug is here:

****My device:****

  The end goal is to make a complete jailbreak for all A4 devices, but my only A4 device is an iPod 4g, so that's what I'm starting with. First tests were done on iOS 6.1.6
